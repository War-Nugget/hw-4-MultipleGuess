Multiple Guess was the fourth homework given to me by Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp. This is essentially a multiple choice quiz I have made up using javascript and css that saves the high score. This assignment has taught me that I need to work better on my knowledge on storing data locally on ones device every time you insert an item.

## These were the steps I have taken to complete this assignment.

# 1. HTML
- The html was very simple to write and took barley none at all. 
- Starts with the start quiz button which initiates the quiz.
- Added divs for the questions, counter, time gauge and little progress bubbles on whether the question is right or wrong.

# 2. Javascript
- Started off declaring variables needed and writing questions into an array.
- Then added a function to render question into the html question elements.
- The start button function initiates the quiz and renders the timer (with a bar) and progress bubbles.
- The final bit was to check if answers were right and to tally up the score.

# 3. CSS 
- I did not use bootstrap for the css so it was longer than expected.
- Most of the css was to display where all elements were located such as questions.
- All questions you could hover were bolded and thicker border size.
